# Feedback System Implementation

## Overview
The feedback system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Feedback Popup**
   - Appears after user has been on the website for 5 minutes
   - Offers "Give Feedback" or "Remind me later" options
   - If "Remind me later" is clicked, popup reappears after 15 minutes
   - Won't show again if user has already submitted feedback

2. **Manual Feedback Button**
   - Added to sidebar above the Sign Out button
   - Uses a heart icon for better visual appeal
   - Available in both expanded and collapsed sidebar states

3. **Feedback Form**
   - Four rating sections with 1-5 star ratings:
     - Accuracy rating (1 = Lowest, 5 = Highest)
     - Speed rating (1 = Slow, 5 = Very Fast)  
     - Overall rating (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent)
   - Optional text feedback section
   - Supports both new submissions and updates to existing feedback

4. **Backend API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/feedback` - Submit or update feedback
   - `GET /api/feedback/{user_id}` - Get existing user feedback
   - Proper validation for rating values (1-5)
   - Integration with existing Supabase database

### Database Schema
The feedback table is already created with the following structure:
```sql
- id (serial, primary key)
- user_id (text, not null)
- accuracy_rating (integer, 1-5)
- speed_rating (integer, 1-5) 
- overall_rating (integer, 1-5)
- text_feedback (text, optional)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `frontend/src/components/Feedback/FeedbackModal.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Feedback/FeedbackPopup.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Feedback/index.js`

**Modified Files:**
- `backend/backend_api.py` - Added feedback endpoints and models
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added feedbackAPI methods
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.js` - Added FeedbackPopup
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/Sidebar.js` - Added feedback button
- `frontend/src/index.css` - Added animation styles

### How It Works

1. **Timer Tracking**: Session timer starts when user logs in
2. **Local Storage**: Uses localStorage to track:
   - Session start time
   - Last feedback submission time
   - "Remind me later" timestamp
3. **Automatic Popup**: Shows after 5 minutes if no feedback submitted
4. **Manual Access**: Always available via sidebar button
5. **Data Persistence**: Saves to Supabase and allows updates

### Testing
- Backend: Running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
- Both servers are operational and feedback system is functional

The implementation maintains the existing functionality while adding a comprehensive feedback system that follows the specified requirements.
